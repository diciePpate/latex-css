However, creating and activating wallpapers for Kontakt libraries is not a straightforward process. You need to have the right image dimensions, file formats, and activation files to make them work properly. In this article, we will show you how to create and activate Kontakt library wallpapers using some online tools and resources.
 
## What You Need
 
To create and activate Kontakt library wallpapers, you will need the following:
 
- A Kontakt library that you want to customize. It can be a commercial or a free library, as long as it is not licensed by Native Instruments. You can find many Kontakt libraries online, such as [this collection](https://www.magesypro.com/kontakt-library-wallpaper-activation-file-collection/) of wallpapers and activation files for 15 popular libraries.
- An image editing software, such as Photoshop, GIMP, or [Canva](https://www.canva.com/), which is a free online tool that lets you create graphics easily.
- An image source, such as your own photos, stock images, or [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/), which is a website that offers free high-quality photos for any purpose.
- A `.nicnt` file, which is a special file that tells Kontakt how to recognize and activate your library. You can create your own `.nicnt` file using [this tool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_j7jgPnDEA), or use one from an existing library that has a similar name and size as yours.

## How to Create a Kontakt Library Wallpaper
 
To create a wallpaper for your Kontakt library, follow these steps:

1. Open your image editing software and create a new document with the dimensions of 760 x 340 pixels. This is the standard size for Kontakt library wallpapers.
2. Import or paste your image source into the document and adjust it to fit the canvas. You can crop, resize, rotate, or apply filters to your image as you like.
3. Add any text or logos that you want to include on your wallpaper. Make sure they are legible and do not cover important parts of the image.
4. Save your wallpaper as a `.png` or `.tga` file with the same name as your library. For example, if your library is called "Cinematic Strings Pro", your wallpaper should be called "Cinematic Strings Pro.png" or "Cinematic Strings Pro.tga".

## How to Activate a Kontakt Library Wallpaper
 
To activate a wallpaper for your Kontakt library, follow these steps:

1. Copy or download the `.nicnt` file that corresponds to your library. If you created your own `.nicnt` file using the tool mentioned above, make sure you edit it with a text editor and change the name and size values to match your library.
2. Paste the `.nicnt` file and the wallpaper file into the root folder of your library. This is the folder that contains the "Samples" and "Instruments" subfolders.
3. Open Kontakt and click on "Add Library" under the Libraries tab of the browser. Navigate to the folder where you placed the `.nicnt` file and select it.
4. Your new library wallpaper should now appear within Kontakt. You can browse and load the instruments from your library as usual.
